## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the template files from the repository or source.
2. Extract the downloaded files to a location of your choice.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. After the installation is complete, run the command `ng serve` to start the development server.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the website.

## Customization

### Changing the logo and branding

1. Locate the `src/assets` folder in the project directory.
2. Replace the `logo.png` file with your own logo file. Make sure the new logo file has the same name and file format.
3. Open the `src/app/components/navbar` folder.
4. Open the `navbar.component.html` file in a text editor.
5. Locate the HTML element that displays the logo (e.g., `<img src="assets/logo.png" alt="Logo">`).
6. Update the `src` attribute with the appropriate path to your new logo file.

### Modifying the navigation menu

1. Open the `src/app/components/navbar` folder.
2. Open the `navbar.component.html` file in a text editor.
3. Customize the list items within the `<ul>` element to match your website's navigation structure.
4. Update the router links using Angular's routerLink directive to point to the appropriate routes in your application.

### Adding/removing pages and content

1. Open the `src/app` folder.
2. Create a new folder for your desired page (e.g., `about`, `menu`, `contact`).
3. Inside the new folder, create a new component using the Angular CLI command `ng generate component page-name`.
4. Open the generated component files (`page-name.component.ts`, `page-name.component.html`, `page-name.component.css`) in a text editor.
5. Customize the component's logic and HTML to create the desired content for the page.
6. Register the new component in the `app.module.ts` file by importing and adding it to the `declarations` array.
7. Update the

 routing configuration in the `app-routing.module.ts` file to include the new route and component.

### Styling and design

1. Open the component's CSS file (e.g., `page-name.component.css`) in the respective component folder.
2. Customize the CSS styles to modify the colors, typography, layout, or any other visual aspect of the page.
3. Utilize Angular's component-specific CSS encapsulation to ensure styles only affect the intended components.

### Deploying the website

1. Build the production-ready files by running the command `ng build --prod`.
2. The build output will be stored in the `dist` folder.
3. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web hosting server using an FTP client or any other preferred method.
4. Configure your web server to serve the Angular application. Ensure that URL rewriting is correctly set up for Angular's routing to work properly.
